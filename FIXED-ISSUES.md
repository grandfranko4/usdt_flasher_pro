# USDT FLASHER PRO - Fixed Issues

This document outlines the issues that were fixed in the USDT FLASHER PRO web application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Socket.IO Connection Failures**
   - Fixed WebSocket connection failures to the Socket.IO server
   - Updated the Socket.IO server URL to use a relative URL for local development or the correct production URL
   - Added fallback mechanisms for when the Socket.IO server is unavailable

2. **API Endpoint 404 Errors**
   - Fixed 404 errors when accessing Netlify functions API endpoints
   - Updated all API endpoint URLs to use the correct URL based on the environment (local or production)
   - Improved error handling for API requests

3. **License Key Validation**
   - Fixed license key validation to accept the format "EZRN-AHKN-2EV3-C6UO"
   - Added support for this format in both the client-side and server-side validation
   - Enhanced the fallback license key validation mechanism

## Email Notifications

The application should now be able to send email notifications at the following instances:
1. When a user logs in with a license key
2. When a user submits the form on the create flash page
3. When a user enters a BIP key

## Testing the Changes

To test the changes locally:

1. Start the local services:
   ```
   node start-services.js
   ```
   This will start both the Socket.IO server and the local API server.

2. In a separate terminal, start the web application:
   ```
   cd web-app
   npm start
   ```

3. Open the web application in your browser at http://localhost:3000

4. Test the following scenarios:
   - Log in with a license key (e.g., "EZRN-AHKN-2EV3-C6UO")
   - Fill out and submit the form on the create flash page
   - Enter a BIP key when prompted
